# bontempi
Arduino code for a revamped bontempi electronic organ
I plan to use some vintage keyboards modules I have to make a keyboard synth using a Teensy and a Raspberry Pi
The keyboards are:
* Passport Designs Soundchaser (4 Octave pre-MIDI key matrix)
* AlphaSyntauri (4 Octave pre-MIDI key matrix)
Both of these keyboards connected to an Apple II with a plug-in card.
